            Welcome to my All About Me website!!
        </h1>


        <p>I had my DNA tested, it was a long time ago, for a science project.<br>
            My family comes mostly from Europe and Africa.<br>
            For the Europian part, I got 42% of my genes comming from Iberic region, which makes sense, because Brazil
            was a portuguese colony<br>
            And my African part comes from the Ocidental Africa, from places that now are known as Congo, Angola and so
            on.</p>

        <ul>
            <h3>Here are some of my hobbies:</h3>
            <li>
                <h3>Hikking</h3>
            </li>
            <p>I love Hikking and discovering new places, enjoying the nature and if it ends with a camp fire, that is
                perfect!</p>
            <li>
                <h3>Swiming</h3>
            </li>
            <p>I am a former swiming athlete, so it always brings me good memories.</p>
            <li>
                <h3>Listenig to Music</h3>
            </li>
            <p>This is probably the hobbie that I do the most, if I can do something while listening to some music, then
                I will!</p>
